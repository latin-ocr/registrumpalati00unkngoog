feoffment, and this was not permitted3 the bishop doth
will and grant, that their estate be upheld, such as it was
in the time of their predecessorS, and such as they have
and [have] enjoyed, ancestrally or by feoffment.

And that the free men of the free chase be not charged
with more forestcrs than they used to have, and that no
ward be divided among two, and that no forest-er be on
horseback save only the two masters. And that the
foresters on foot take no cornsheaves or other things
except from henceforth fiom grassmen and their bond-
men, but just as they were wont to take of them be-
fore, in the time of his predecessors3 the bishop doth
will and grant, as to taking cornsheaves, that they take
neither sheaves nor any other things, from free tenantS,
nor yet from otherS, otherwise than they were wont to do

according to laW. And the king doth will that the cor-

And in cases where his wastes were let to ferm, and
then waived through poverty‚ in the free chase and with-
out, 1118 bailiffs came there, and took their beasts from
the next neighbours, and levied the ferm from them,
