This work contains a number of very curioua and interesting incidente, and,
being the work of a contemporary, ie very valuable, not only aa a truthful
biography of a celebrated ecclesiastic, but aa the work of a man, who, from per-
sonal knowledge, gives noticea of parting events, aa well aa of individuals who
vere then taking active part in public affairs. The author, in all probability,
πο Adam Abbot of Eveaham. He was domestic chaplain aud private confessor
of Biahop Hugh, and in theae capacitiea was admitted to the eloaeat intimacy.
Biahop Hugh van Prior of Witham sor 11 years before he became Bishop of
Lincoln. His consecration took place on the ssiat September 1186 ; he died on
the leth of November 12003 and ἱνα canonized in 1220.

The anthonhip of the Chronicle in Vol. 1., hitherto ascribed to Geoffrey
Vineaauf, ie now more correctly ascribed to Richard, Canon ot* the Holy Trinity
of London. The narrative extende from 1187 to 1199; but its chief interest
consiste in the minute and authentic narrative which it furnishes of the exploits
of Richard 1., from hia departure from England in December 1189 to hia death
in 1199. The author states in hie prologue that he was an eye—witness of much
that he recorda ς and various incidental circumstances which occur in the course
of the narrative confirm thia assertion. ·

The lettera in Vol. 11., written between 1187 and 1199, are of value as
furniahing authentic materiale for the history of the ecclesiastical condition of
England during the reign of Richard Ι. Theyhad their origin in a dispute which
arose from the attempta of Baldwin and Hubert, archbiahopa of canterma-y, to
found a college of secular mona, a project which gave great umbrage to the
monka of cantet-bury, who aaw in it a deaign to supplant them in their fimetion
of metropolitan chapter. These lettera are printed, for the first time, from a MS.
belonging to the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth.
