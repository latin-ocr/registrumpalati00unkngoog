Τ116 works to 116 publishcd in oetam, separately, as
they were finished ; the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon tho editors, who· wcre to bc chosen by the
Master of 1110 Rous with 1110 sanction of the Treasmy.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, after a careful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “ was well

calculated foi· the accomph‘shment of this important ι

1161101161 object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, 61111 provided proper attention bc

paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangementS,
without unnecessary expense.”

They expressed their 611111011611011 of the proposal that
each Chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent With all possible correct-
ness the text of each writer, derived from a collation of the

‚ best MSS„ and that no notes should be added, except

such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the preface to each work should
contain, in addition to tho particulars proposed by the
Master of the Rous, a biographical account of the author,
so far as authentic materials existed for that purpose,
and an estimato of his historical credibility and value.

Roas House,
December 1857.
