about the end of the fourteenth century, consecrated Bishop of St. Amph in
the year 1444, and translated to the see of chichester in 1450. While Bishop of
itt. Asaph, he zealously defended his brother prelates from the attacks of those
who censured the bishops for their neglect of duty. He maintained that it vas no
part of a bishop’s fimetions to appear in the pulpit, and that his time might be
more profitably spent, and his dignity better maintained, in the performance os
vorks of a higher character. Among those who thought differently vere the

took up a position midway between that of the Roman Church aud that of the
modern Anglican Church; but his work is interesting chiefly because it gives a
full account of the vievs of the Lollards and of the arguments by which they vere
supported, and becauoe it assists us to ascertain the state of feeling which ulti·

These annals, which are in Latin, commence in the year 447, and come down
to the year 1288. The earlier portion appears to be taken from an Irish Chmnicle,
which was also used by Tigernach, and by the compilet of the Annals of Ulster.
During its first century it contains scarcely anything relating to Britain, the
earliest direct concurreuce with English history is relative to the misaiou of
Augustine. Its notices throughout though brief, are valuable. The anuals
were probably written at St. DavidS, by Blegewryd, Arehdeacon of Llandafl',

the most learned man in his day in all Cymru.

These volumes contain the historical works of Gerald du Barry, who lived
in the reigns of Henry 11., Richard 1.‚ and John, and attempted to re-establish
the independence of Wales by restoring the see of St. Davids to its ancient
primacy. Ilis works are of a very miscellaneous nature, both in prose and
verse, and are remarkable chiefly for the racy and original anecdotes which
they contain relating to contemporaries. He is the only Welsh writer ot* any
importance who has contributed so much to the mediseval literature of th'ss
country, or assumed, in consequence of his nationality‚ so free and independent
a tone. His frequent travels in Italy, in France, in Ireland, and in Wales, gave
him opportunities for observation which did not generall fall to the lot of medioeval
writers in the twelsth aud thirteenth centuries, and of t ese observations Giraldus
has made due use. Only extraets from these treatises have been printed before,
and almoet all of them are taken from unique manuscripts.

The Topographia Hiber-nica (in Vol. V.) is the result of Giraldus’ two visits to
Ireland. The first in the year 1183, the second in 1185-6, when he aceompanied
Prince John into that country. Curious as this treatise is, Mr. Dimoek is of
opinion that it ought not to be accepted as sober truthful history, for Giraldus
himself states that truth vas not his main object, and that he compiled the work
sor the purpose of sounding the praises of, Hem-y the Second. Elsewhere, hov-
ever, he declares that he had stated nothing in the Topographia of the truth of
which he vas not well assured, either by his own eyesight or by the testimony,
with all diligenee elicited‚ of the most trustworthy and authentic men in the
country 3 that though he did not put just the same full saith in their reports as
in what he had himself seen, yet, as they only related what they had themselves
seen, he could not but believe such credible witnesses. A very interesting portion
of this treatise is devoted to the animale of Ireland. It shows that he was a very
accurate and acute observet, and his descriptione are given in a way that ι
scientific naturalist of the present day could hardly improve upon. The Expug-
natio Hiberuica was written about the year 1188 and may be regarded rather
