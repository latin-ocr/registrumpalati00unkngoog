men had been extended to the field of theology and they appear both in the
writings of Wycliff and in those os his adversaries. Wycliff’s little bundles

This is a metrical translation of a Latin Prose Chronicle, and was written in the
first hals of the leth century. The narrative begins with the earliest legende,
and ends with the death of Jamcs 1. of Scotland, and the “ evil ending of the
traitors that slew him.” Strict accuracy of statement is not to be looked for in
such a work as this ς but the stories of the colonization of Spain, Ireland, and
Scotland are interesting if not true ; and the chronicle is valuable as a reflection
of the mannerS, sentimentS‚ and character of the age in which it was composed.
The peculiarities of the Scottish dialect are ‘well illustrated in this metrical version,
and the student of language will find ample materials for comparison with the
English dialects of the same period, and with modern lowland Scotch.
