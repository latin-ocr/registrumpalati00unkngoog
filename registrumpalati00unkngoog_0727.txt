Edward, by the grace oi God, king of England, lord
of Ireland‚ and duke of Aquitaine, bo the honourable
father in Goe1, Richard by the same grace, bishop of
Durham‚ greeting. Whereas we have in divers counties
of England commanded that purveyance of victuals
for our garrisons of Scotland be made, the which pur-
veyanceS, even though they be as quickly made as
they can hasten them, still perhaps will not be able to
come ‘oo our said garrisons so soon as .might· be neces-
sary, through hindrance by sea, or other disturbance
that might ,happen‚ and we much dread that damage
or peril might arise, which may God forbid, unto our
said garrisons for 'default of victuals3 we do pray and
charge you strictly, that, these letters being seen,
you cause word to be sent ‘oo your ministerS, and to
your people at. Alyeland and those parts, that they be
aiding, and counselling‚ and obedient to, our dear clerk,
Masber John de Weston’‚ our chamberlain of scotland,
'oo cause victuals to be purveyed and bought to our
use, ab reasonable price, such as they shall find in the
said parts, for our garrisons above mentioned, in such
manner that no damage or peril may arise, the which
may God forbid, through default· of victuals3 for we
have charged our said chamberlain, that, for the eost
of. the said victuals, he cause bills bo be made, under the
seal of his office, unto those of whom the same victuals
shall have been purveyed and bought& by witness of
which bills we will cause them 'oo be duly 'paid for the
same at our Exchequer. Given under our Privy Seal, at

Newcastle-on-Tyne, the 13th day of April, the year of
our reign the fisth.
