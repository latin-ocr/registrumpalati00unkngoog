Necknm vas ι man who devoted himself to science, such as it vus in the-
tvelsth century. In the ‘⁸ De Naturis Rerum '' ure to be found what my be
called the rudiments of man scieuces mixed up with much error and ignoruuce.
Necksm πει not thought in emble, even by his contemporaries, for Roget Bucen
remarks of him, “ this Alexander in many things wrote what vus true und useful ς
“ but he neither cun nor o ht by just title to be reekoned among authorities?
Necksm, however, had cient independence of thought to differ stom some
of the schoolmen who in his time‘considered themselves the only judges of liter·-
ture. He had his own views in mornls, und in giving us a glimpse of them, ss
well as of his other opinions, he throws much light upon the manners, castoras,
und general tone of thought prevalent in the tvelsth century. The poem entitleu
‘⁶ De Laudibus Divino Sapientia ’⁹ appears to be u metrical pnmphnse ω-
ahridgment of the “ De Nuturis nerana· It is mitten in the elegiae mette:

und though there tre many lines which violste elsssicul mles, it is, os n whole,

stition. In addition to the infor-motion bearing direotly upon the medical skffl
and medical ihith of the times. there ure many passages which incideutnlly tiu-ov
light ufon the general {node of life and ordinat>- diet. The volumes are interesting
not on y m their scnennfic, but also iu their sociat aspect. The manuscripts from

which they hove been printed ure vnlusble to the Anglo-Snxon scholar for the
illustratione they afford of Anglo-Ssxon orthography.
