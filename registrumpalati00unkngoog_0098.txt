evident that. six marks per annum was {hen a sufficient &Effigss' ⁸
title for orders. Lyndewode, however, states that as the ⁰ en.
articles necessary for life rose in price, so the allowance
was increased, and in stipendaries ib was advanced ’oo
eight or ben markS, which, according bo Spelman’s com-
putatiom amounted to about ool. per annum. This again
was increased by degrees, and in the time of Henry
VIII„ the stipend of a priest, having the cure of souls,
came up bo sl„ equal ’oo about 80l. a year at the present
day, so that, upon the same principles that Ι have
supposed, the title for orders would be increased in the
same ratio, and in the reign of James Ι. it varied between
6l. 138. 4ᾱ., 8l.‚.and 10l. equal to about 100l. now

“ quod acceptandum duxeriS, sib provisum ;'' and John
de Hothum had an annual pension of 20 marks, until he
should be provided with a competent benefice. Henry ¹
de Appelby, perpetual vicar of Deffington, upon resign-
ing his vicarage‚ on account of his age and infirmities‚
had a grant from the bishop of an annual pension
of 10 marks, to be paid to him by his successor out. of
“ the fruits and obventions of the said vioarage. The
fact of a pension of 10 marks being granted to the
retii-ing vicar shows that the vicarage itself must. have

been of considerable value to have stood such a charge.
