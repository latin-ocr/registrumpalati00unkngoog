of the bishops of Durham and was treated as part 01'31211 urg-1¹·

from the crown‚ in exchange for six knights’ sees in the
county of Lincoln, and on payment of 600 marks, The

Charter, by which this commutation was effected, bears

Of Richard I. The bishop, however, only retained the ¹3.³⁵¹2,‘{,¹' 1332·-

manor and the wapentake for about four yearS, when they {fvybffgg

were seized back into the hands of the eroum, on pre· ssiiieffssrit.

tence that a new grant was requisite on account of the
King's seal, which had ratified the charter, having been
lost. This imposition was for a time resisted by Pudsey,
but just as he was on the point of yielding to this eom-
bined tyranny and extortion he died.

6. His successor, Philip de PoitierS, exhibiting the like gliffissndo

anxiety to secure the domain of Sadberge, proffered the g‘ffiiffib,

King an additional 500 marks for it: an offer which was {322501211011 ·

accepted ; but before the bargain was closed, King Riehard ξξὲξξιῐὲἐξ,

himself died, and his immediate successor, John, seized ggftsstgsss·

the welcome opportunity ofextracting from the solicitous ffg’ffifffflss
prelato an additional fine to complete the transaction.
The result was that the bishop had to pay no less
than 1,200 marks for the King's confirmation of the
grant of the manor of Sadberge, with the Wapentako
and its appurtenances3 combined with liberty to dis-
sorest Crec and Clive, and an acquittance of the aid,
which the King demanded of the whole realm on his

return to England from Normandy.¹
