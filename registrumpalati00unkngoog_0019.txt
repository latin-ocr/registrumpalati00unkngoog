X PREFACE.

7. The royal Charter, bearing date the 4th of March,
confirmed to the bishop¹ and his successore the manor of
Sadberge, with the Wapentake, knights' feeS, and all a}-
purtenances 111 wood and plain, with soc and sac, tol and
theam, and infangenthef, with all liberties and free cus—
tomS, together with pleas pertaining to the crown, as‘wheu
King Richard had them in his own hand, and as the
bishop has and holds his other lands and sees in , 111,-
bishoprio. Hence, by this Charter the bishops of Durham
claimed, of right, to have Jwra reqalia within this dis-
trict, and continued to exercise them therein‚ as long as
they enj oyed the like rights in the other parts of thr

¹¹03- Palatinate. At the same time, it must be remarked that.

the see appears to have paid to the crown an annual
quitrent of 232. 143. 3d. for Sadberge3 from which it
would 66661 that, after all, the fee simple did not
belong- to the bishops so fully as did their other posses-
sions in the Palatinam, but rather that they held it 66

n of the gist of ang Richard from his demesne—de corpore
ο Comitatus N orthwmbrice. Indead, by proceedings in

Parliament in the year 1306, it would appear that

nc ion there was a marked distinction between the ancient
0 5² possessione of the see, and those subsequently acquired
2¹1 by it; for it was alleged respecting Sadberge, that it
· was a manor newly purchased from the ,crown, and

quite estranged from the royal franchise of the bishopric,

8. A similar plea was raised by the King’s attorney-

’ξ general 16 1116 reign of Ed'ward Ι. He argued that the
e - grant of Sadberge to the bishop, by King John, was within

legal memory, and therefore the bishop’s claim to [τινα
v· egydia within that district was invalid.
9. It has not been ascertained what was the extent of

the Wape‘ntaloe of Sadberge 16 the time of King John, but
16 all probability it embraced the whole of the southern
