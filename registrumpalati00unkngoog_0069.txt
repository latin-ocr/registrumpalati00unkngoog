117. In 12].1,1 Eimeric, archdeacon of Durham‚ and

yw¹¹r⁰3 Philip de U'lecotes', render their account of 700 marks and

35 ‘marks for seven palfreys of the knights of Halwarfolk,
and 70 marks as Queen’s gold of the same knights for
the use of the Queen, for having the assize of the king-
dom of England‚ saving the libel-ties of the Bishop of
Durham. Bishop Hugh [Pudsey] addresses a charter to
his barone, knights, and men of Haliwercfolc, French and
English. In 1221, the bailiffs of the Bishop of Durham,²
in Haliwarcfolc, are commanded that, as to the chatteh,
stock‚ corn, and other moveable things, which belonged
to Philip de Ulecote5‚ deceased, in Haliwarefole, they ‚do
cause the money arising therefrom to be delivered, to his
executore. A mandate to the Bishop of Durham ³ and
his chancellor, in the year 1223, reciting the complaint
of the prior of Durham, respecting the seizure of cattle,
plough8‚ and men, commanda the bishop to deliver up
the same, until he gives seem-ity, &c -‘ ‘Nor shall we be

“able any further to omit, if, upon repetition of our
“ mandate to you, you do not cause the men and cattle
“ aforesaid to be delivered up, to lay our hands, (which is
“ still a thing grievous and troublesome to us), upon your
“ lands and property out of the Haliwarcsok, by reason
“ thereof.” In the year 1225 (23 May), all persons
established within Haliworfolk are commanded to pay
promptly into the bishop’s hands the money which the
lord the King hae ordered to be assessed {by the hand
of the Bishop of Durham on their moveable things.
In the 51st year of the reign of Hemy III. (ΑΒ. 1267),
the manor of Gretham is described as being “ in libertate
“ episcopi Dunelmensis Aliwarcfolkfi
