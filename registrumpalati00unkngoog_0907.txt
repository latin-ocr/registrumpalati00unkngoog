day ofthe battle (28 April 1014) coincided with nuntiem mad that the manuring
tide in the evening aided considerably in the defeat of the Dones. The fiet has
been verified by asn'onomieal calculatione, and the inference is that the author of

This work hae long been jnstly celebrated, but not-thoronghly understood until
Mt. Stubbs’ edition. The earlier portion, extending stom 732 to 1148, appears
to be a copy of a com ilation made in Northnmbrit about 1101, to which
Hoveden added little. om 1148 to 1169—o, very vnlnahle portion of this
work—the matter is derived from another source, to which Hoveden appears to
have supplied little, and not almas jndiciously. From 1170 to 1192 is the

ortion which coi-responde with e Chronicle known under the name of
{enedict of Peterborough (sec No. 49); hut. it iz not a copy, being sometimes
an abi-idgment, at others a pmphrnee3 occasionally the tvo vorke entirely
ngree; showing that both writers hed necess ,to the same materiale, but dealt
with them differently. From 1192 to 1201 may be said to be wholly Hoveden's
work ε it is extremely veluahle, and nn authority of the first importance.
