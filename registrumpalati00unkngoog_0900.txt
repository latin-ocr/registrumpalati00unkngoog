as a great epic than a sober relation of acts occur-ring in his own days. No
one can pet-use it·without coming to the conclusion that it is rather a poetical
fiction than a prosaic truthful history. ·

Vol. VI. contains the Itinerarium Kambriae et Descriptio Kambrioe.

The letters and papers contained in these volumes are derived chiefly from
originale or contemporary copies extant in the Bibliotheque ῙιιιρότὶαῙθ, and the
Depbt des Archives, in Paris. They illustrate the line of policy adopted by
John Duke of Bedford and his successors during their government of Normandy,
and such other provinces of France as had been acquired hy Henry V. We

may here truce, step by step, the gradual declension of the English power, until
we are prepared to read of its final overthrow. ·

This Chronicle, extending from the earliest history of Britain to the year
1154, is justly the beust of Englund3 for no other nation can produce any history,
written in its own vernaculas, at all approaching it, either in antiquity, truthful-
ness, or extent, the historical books of the Bible alone excepted. Tbere are at
present six independent manuscripts of the Saxon Chronicle, ending in different
years, and written in different parts of the country. In this edition, the text
of each manuscript is printed in columns on the same page, so that the student
may see at a glauce the various changes which occur in orthography, whether ,
arising from locality or age.

The Papers are derived from MSS. in the Public Record Office, the British
Mamm,- and other repositories. The period to which they refer is unusually
destitute of chronicles and other sources, of historical information, so that the
light obtained from these documents is of special importance. The principal
contents 'of the volumes are some diplomatic Papers of Richard 111. 5 correspon-
dence between Henry VII. and Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain3 documents
relating to Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk; and a portion of the corre-
spondence of J ames IV. of scotland.

The Letters ofRobert Grosseteste (13 1 in number) are here collected from various
sources, and a large portion of them is printed for the first time. They range in
date from about 1210 to 1253, and relate to various matters connected not onl
with the political history of England during the reign of Hem-y 111„ bnt wit
its ecclesiastical condition. They refer especially to the diocese of Lincoln, of
which Grosseteste was bishop. ’
