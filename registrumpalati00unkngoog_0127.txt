¹ The Chureh of England seems · “

to have retained, until a compara-
tively late period, the right of pun-
ishmfflt for want of religione deeo-
rum3 for instance, in the year 1636,

Joseph Phenn was arraigned be- “

cause “ 110 did smile, as many others
“ in the ehureh did, at one that
“ came into the chureh with his face
“ all crock't.'’ In 1617, Richard
Downham was presented for 010οΡ-
ing in chureh, and 110 alleged “that
‘⁶ he did not sleepe in the ehureh
“ this twelvemonth.'’ In 1638,
John Smith was presented “ for not
“ bowing at the name of J esus ς for
‘⁶ Ιῖ10011113, and not standing, at
“ t 0 Creed3 for not ansvering
‘⁸ with a loud voice to the responds;
‘⁴ for not turning his face towards
“ the East at the Doxologies‚ Creed,

and Gospell3 '⁹ and “ Sargent
“ Winckfeld was presented for mis-
“ demeanour and unseemingly ac-
“ tione, by casting thinges at the
“ :naides in Sex-mon tyme, and
sticking feathers on a maides
“ waisteoat.'’ The churehwardene
of St. olave’s, in Silver Street, Lon-
don, presented Elimbeth Bateman,
“ for that on Sunday the 2nd of
“ February, 1639, last, in the fore-
“ nocue, at the time of divine
“ prayerS, after the Second Lesson‚
“ she did not kneele‚ and did talke
“ to them 111 the 11οκῒο place to her,
“ and when she was admonished
‘⁶ by the Senon, who was sent by
‘⁶ the churehwardens‚ she very
“. seornfully answered, ‘ 0111 let
“ ⁴ them present mee.' ”
