Capgrave was prior of Lynn, in N orfolk‚ and provincial of the order ol the
Friars Hermits of England shortly before the year 1464. His . Chronicle extends
from the creation of the world to the year 1417. As a record of the language
spoken in Norfolk (being written in English), it is of considerable value.

This Chronicle traces the history of the great Benedict'me monastery ol
Abingdon in Berkshire‚ from its foundation by King Ina of Ἤρκει, to the
reign of Richard 1.‚ shortly after which period the present narrative was drawn
up by an inmate of the establishment. The author had access to the title-deeris
of the house3 and incorporates into his history various charters of the Saxon
king-s, of great im portance aa illustrating not only the history of the locality
bnt that of the kingdom. The work is printed for the first time.

The first is a poem in Norman French, containing 4, 686 lines, addressed ιο
Alianor, Queen of Henry ΙΠ,, and probably written in the year 1245, on the
occasion of the restoration of the church of westminster. Nothing is known
of the author. The second’ is an anonymous poem, containing 536 lines, written
between the years 1440 and 1450, by command of Hem-y VL, to whom it
is dedicated. It does not throw any new light on the reign of Edward the
Confessor, but' is valuable as a specimen of the Latin poetry of the time. The

. third, also by an ‚anonymous author, was apparently written for Qneen Edith.
between the years 1066 and 1074, during the pressure of the suffering brought
on the Saxons by the Norman conquest. It notices many facts not nugfound ιιι
other writers, and some which differ considerably from the usual accounts.
