“ ‘ in our [2 your] diocese, the bearer of these presente, by

of an act of singular cruelty in the
abbey of St. Alban’e. A monh,
who was acoused of insufferable
pride, was savagely castigated, for
the purpose of subduing. his so-

his bones in the gyves and mana-

life.

reason) ,116 dreaded the ‘⁴ Vade

unrepenting offenders were com-
