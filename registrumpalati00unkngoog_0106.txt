PREFACE. xcvii

“ there may not, though your lukewarmness in this
“ matter, (as we trust may not be 1116 casa) any damage
“ or peril in any way arise.’'
, 170. There is still further evidence on 11116 subject in Evidence

another MS. preserved at, Durham‚¹ wherein it appears {ffr‘ssffif

that the prior and convent of Durham entered inho a guxffinmo
bond with 1116 Earl of Moray, lieutenant of 1116 King ghboffi witi}
of Scotland, 10 pay, on behalf of 1116 commonalby of 1116 ξέῑεῑῇἕῐῖ
bishopric of Durham‚ 800 markS, for having peace and {¹233}aeoe-

suspension of warfare; and for 1116 full payment· of which
they gave hostageS, by way of surety, from 1116 com-
monalty of 1116 bishopric of Durham

171. The Scottish warS, as may be supposed, gave mmuble
Bishop Kellawe continued trouble and annoyance, and ffiffiuissp

kept him in constant anxiety throughout 1116 whole of ΞΞοΞῗὼ

his episcopabe.
172. At the very commencement of his episcopate, we ginssent VI·

find 1116 King writing bo Pope Clemens, VI„ who had sum- {25¹5ss
moned Kellawe 10 611611ᾱ a General CounciL requesting gfossssgnoe

his Holiness 10 excuse 1116 absence of 1116 Bishop from 3333311

that meeting, inasmuch as his presence was required at.
1116 Parliament, about 10 be held at London‚ to concert
measureS, with 1116 011161· prelates and peers, for the pro-
tection of 1116 realm against Robert de Brus and his re-
bellious accomplices, all of them public robbers, who were
devastating 1116 King's lands in Scotland, and invading
1116 marshes of 1116 realm of England, especially 1116
bishopric of Durham‚ where they were perpetrating ra—
pine, depredatione burnings, and mul-ders upon women,
children, and holy men.

173. So greatly was Kellawe disquieted and perplexed {ssm‘ffed
by these hostiflffies, that. he, was compelled, much to his {afflegem ω
sorrow, 10 postpone his intended visitation of 1116 arch- ξξζῖξὲξῗιξξὲ
dcaconry of N orthumberland‚ by reason ,of the incur- {¹323}ss 02

sions of 1116 86016, and the formidable perils assoenfflng ffessfflffln·
