Archbishop of Canterbury‚ in the Benedictine Abbey at
Ohertsey, on the 19th of December 1333, the Sunday
preceding his 46th birthday. He ,was installed by
proxy on the lOth of J anuary 1334, and enthroned 011
1110 4111 of June, on which occasion he royally entertained
the King and Queen of England the King of scotland,
the two Metropolitum, five other 111011οΡ0, seven earls,
and their countesses, and all the nobility north of the
Trent, with a vast concourse of persons of distinction.
He was made Treasurer of the Exchequer on the 3rd of 1330 m

February 1334 (Pat, p. 1, 8 Edw. ΙΙΙ., 111. 40), 01111 011011- Ex xcuhen uer

like capacity to Antwerp and Brabant. He does not seem ffltfm
to have taken any very active part in the Scottish wars,
though he deemed it his duty to see that none of the
liberties of his Palatinate were inffinged or lessened ²3
at the same time he attended with scrupulous care to the
affairs of 1110 diocese. The remains of his Register and
the records of 1110 Chaucery will show what his principa]
acts were in 1110 pontifice] and palatine capacity.

238. Richard de Bury seems to have selected his His n-iends
friends from those 0001001001100 who were best known for {Q
their erudition. Among them were Thomas Bradwardin men lusda?
and Richard Fi'tz- -Ralph, his familiar chaplains3 both of

whom became metropolitam, the first-named of Canter-

“ the same Richasd, have received
“ sealty of him 00 appointed, 01111
“ have restored the temporalties
“ to him, as is aecustomed.”

¹ In 1336, Bishop Bury had 011
1111οπ01100 of five marks a day, from
the 12th July to the 29111 of Sep-
tember, for his pay in going to
Philip King of France‚ as King
Edward’s Ammonem, in addition

to his passage money and travelling
expenses.

² He, undoubtedly, had his Mint,
for there are two granta to him of
one (Rot. Claus„ 18 Edw. 8., p. 2,
mm. 13 and 21), though none of
his coins are now known to exist3
hence it has been inferred that he
never coined money of any descrip-

tion.
