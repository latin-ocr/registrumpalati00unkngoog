, 0 ’ pt in 1110 Haye of Langwathe3 and also [may eom·
mYQ‚ at open 1111100, 111 fields [and] in meadows after corn
and hay have been carried away, that is to say, beasts

that obme astray and enter thereon without guard of pas-

ture‚ w''th horn and staff ; ¹ but as to pasture in defenoe
beasts o ght not to be allowed on another person’s soil

without the will of him to· whom the soil belongs, 130-

cause that strange folk who have ands between Use and

Derewent'‚· neither are wont nor ought to create usage

between the waters‚ that is strange in all other countries‚

and 0100 the lords and tenants who have [not] approved
all their own wastes greatly desired that their neighbours,
who have large waste, should be prevented from making
approvement‚ because they wished to common therein,
they brought writs of Novel Disseisin of their common
of pasture in one vill as pertaim‘ng to their freehold ·

[situate] in another vill, in the EyreS, against their

Ι neighbours of the other ville, to oust and prevent the

approvements that have been made by their neighbours

of their wastes near [to themJ. And when the usage
was told and pleaded by twelve sworn men before
the justiees in Eyre‚ they agreed and awarded that
the usage has been kept up for so long a time that
they held it as law, and so held as 10 1110 approve-
ments3 in addition 10 which, it has been 011100 averred
and found, by enrolment, at seven of the Eyres that have
been at York3 and this usage Sir Roger de Turkelby,
who was justioe in three Eyres throughout England‚
who was lord of the vill of North Duffeld between
the watem, did not disturb throughout all his domain.
