to whom the Pope, at the King’ s request, had given the
see, brought to Durham the Papal Bull and Royal LetterS.
Upon seeing them, the Archbishop of York, (william de
Melton), wrote to the clergy and people of Durham‚ com-
manding them 10 pay obedience to Richard (16 Bury,
notwithstanding his former letters in favour of Robert
de GraystaneS‚ and stating that he had acted in
ignorance in this matter.1

states that he had confirmed the
election of Graystanes in ignorance
of the Pope’s intended provision,
and directs that Richard‚ the Bishop
elect, shall be properly received.
