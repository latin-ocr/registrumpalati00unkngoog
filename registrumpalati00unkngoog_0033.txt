In the account of Sir william Enrie, knight, the, ‘
escheator within the bishopric of Durham‚ made in the·
2nd year of the episcopate of Cardinal Wolsey, he charges
himself with having received lsscl. from the 1881168 of the
lands and tenements in ancient demesne which lately
belonged to John Sokberne, in Sadberge‚ being in the
hands of the Lord Bishop as an escheat. And also
68. sd. of the 1881168 of one messuage and 25 acres of land
with appartenances in Sadberge‚'which lately belonged 10

the Lord Bishop on account of an alienation made to
William Garmondesway‚ William Enrie, and his fellow5,

reason to conclude that Sadberge was anciently regarded
as a stanchise independent of Durham‚ and entitled
to have its own sheriff, with his tom-n, a coroner, and
other civil officers3 though in many 1118166068, as will
have been observed, the same individual filled the
like office for Durham as well as Sadberge, but gene-
rally by a different patent. It had also its own court
of pleae, the justices of which were commissioned by the
bishop‚ and fines were regularly levied there of lands
within 1116 Wapentake. Indeed‚ by Lambard and some
other writers it has been treated as a County, and nothing
