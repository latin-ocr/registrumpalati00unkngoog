the ceremonial must, to a greater or less extent, have-
been practised in this island some centuries before that

Ξτιῳῖεέξξξθ after the arrival of Augustine‚ places of public worship

”gu ’ were urgently required3 parishes werc an institution be-
longing to a later age, and in no district was there a. resi-
dence for an officiating minister. The bishop, like his great
prototype, was constraincd to send out his clergy into
villages and dwelling-places to supply the spiritual wants
of the people, as occasion required. The temples which
the Romans had consecrated to their numberless deities‚
and which had not beerr destroyed by thc barbariam, as
well as the deserted fanes of the worshippers of Woden,
were speedily converted into Christian churcheS‚ and
ministers to officiate in them were consequently indis-
pensable. The companions of Augustine were nearly

conferred the order of priesthood, so soon as he had been

himself ordained as bishop ; otherwise it would have

been impossible to impart baptism, authoritative teaching,

had embraced the saith in Christ.

frivolities of life. It is not, however, my purpose to enter
into any disquisition upon the qualities or original objects
of this class; it will suffice to say that they formed no
part of the priesthood‚ whose Christian duties were
altogether of a more active character.
