Parmos. xxix

“ England‚ Lord of Ireland‚ and Duke of Aequitain, tho rights or
“ sends greeting. We have received the plaint of the glfflffl'.
“ venerable father LouiS, Bishop of Durham, oontained in
“ his petition exhibited before us and our eouneil in
“ Parliament‚ that, albeit he and his predecessore, the
‘⁶ former bishop3‚ from the time whereof memory runneth
“ not to the contrary, have holden the castle, manor, and
“ liberty of Norbam, with their appurtenaneeS, as pareel
“ of their bishopric of us and our progenitors; and the
“ same bishop and his predecessore heretofom, from the
“ time aforesaid, have had Jwra reyalia within the afore-
“ said liberty, and have in all and singular matters
“ exereised the same by himself and his ministers within
“ the liberty' aforesaid, in what manner soever arising.
“ And albeit the vill of Upsetlington is held of the same
“ bishop, as of his manor ofNorham. And further the
‘⁴ same bishop and his predecessore in all times past (the
“ said 666 'being occupied by our progenitors during
“ the voidance -of the see) have had and held their
“— courts for the tenants of the aforesaid vill at the said

· “ pl'eas ,and plaints whatsoever within the said vill, in
ᾖ what way soever arising as well by their writs as
“ without writS‚'’ &e

49. During the episcopates of Bury, Hatfield, and
Fordham, mention is also made of justices of assiae,
“ 6116111116, and escheators, and other similar officers in
Norhamshire.

50. It seems not out of place to add here a few words
⁰ respecting the episcopal estates in Norhamshire, and the
tenants of the same.—

It has been already mentioned· that Norbam was rho mmor
granted by Bishop Walcher to the prior and convent of ffitffi‘z'ffi'ffi
Dur-ham, and that William de Oarileph confirmed the grant 1ῧὲ Ῑὲῗιῗὲρῗ
of his predecessor. The bishop, however, appears to have ⁰¹ Dumm‘
- retained the manor of Norham3. for we find Hugh Pudsey Privilgges
· issuing‘a· charter of privileges to his burgesses there, ἶιζῖἓιοῗέο
