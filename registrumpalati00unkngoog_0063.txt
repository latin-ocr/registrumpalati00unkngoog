the King's use3 and william son of Waldeve, another
dreng, owing 408. for respite of castle-work, which he
had purchased at that heavy price.

106. In the reign of Hem-y Ι. we meet with an
instance of drengage being changed, upon payment of
a large fine, into tenure ‘in capite, the land to be held
by the same services by which other free men hold their
landa. κ

107. During the episcopate of Ralph Flambard, both
thanes and drengs constituted a numerous section of the

·bishop’s bananias, and we are not without proof also that

drengage tenure obtained in Cumberland, Yorkshire,
and Westmoreland5 but ae to the time at which thie
tenure became extinct no data for exact information
probably now exiet.1 The remembrance of this ancient
tenure is however probably still kept alive in the
names of “ Dringhoe '' and “ Dxinghouse8,” places in
the East Riding of Yorkshire‚ and in the still exieting

the fact that they were not bound to do any other service
than holy work. Their service, as they authoritatively

defence and protection of the body of St. Cuthbert,
ancl ⁵consequently they were altogether exempt from
any summoue to march beyond the confines of the

,bishopric, to fight either for the king or the bishop3 but

if they ever did go out of the franchise for such a pur-
pose, it was at their own free will and option‚ and on

Oardinal Wolsey, and perhaps later, the mauors of the Palatinae.
