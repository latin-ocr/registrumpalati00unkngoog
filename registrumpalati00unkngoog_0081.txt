Magus and his discipleS. There is no doubt that, during
the first four centuries of the Christian era, the clergy
had not affected any peculiar mode of wearing the hair to
distinguish them from the laity. When persecution pre-
vailed, so conspicuous a mark as the tonsure would have
betrayed them to their enemieS. In process of time, how-
ever, the church recommended, or rather did not discoun-
tenance, the shaving of the head, as a mark of humility3
and the monastic orders probably were the first to adopt
it as a symbol of that virtue. The secular clergy followed
the example of the monastic rule about the close of the
fifth century3 at which time both the circular and semi-
circular modes of chaving the head were practiaed. The
ceremonial of the first tonsure is given in detail in the
“ Pontificale Romanum.'’ The bishop clipped the hair of
the candidate in som· places ; on the frent and on the back
of the head, and above each ear, and then on the middle of
the top of the head.¹ Tonsure was performed immediately
after the Introit. Then, the first Lesson ended, the Ostiarii
(doorkeepers or ushers), were ordained3 after the second
Lesson, the Lectors3 ai'ter the third Lex-ison, the Exercists3
after tho fourth, the Acolytes; after the fifth, the Sub-
deaconS. At the conclusion of the Epistlc the Deaoons
were ordained ; and then the Priasus! aster the last verse
of the Tmet.
