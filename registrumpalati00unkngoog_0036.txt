Nor-ham ie, that Ralph Flambard, Bishop of Dur-ham, {xpm br

about the year 1 121, erected a strong eastle there, on the &px-33,

brink- of a} steep rook, upon the spot then known as numam.
“ Ecolisoamford.” Β is unneoessary here to enter into

a description of this celebrated fortress3‚ as my lato
venerated friend Dr. Raine has fully described it in his

“ History of North Durham.” ’

42. In the next episcopate, that of Geoffrey Rufus (Le' 'l'he town
Roux) the casse was assaulted by David 1. of scotland, ῧξιῑὲζὲἓ

Nomhumberland, with his casses), Hugh Bardolf was ἓξὲξ 20„-
