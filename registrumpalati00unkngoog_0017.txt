3. As the Preface to 11110 First Volume was devoted to
an amount of the Palatinam yemrally, my remarks
under this Section wffl more especially point· to certain

of its members, or component parts ; I mean the Wapen-

take of Sadberge, Norhamshire, Islandshire, Bedlingbon-
shire, Alvertonshire, Houedenshire, and Craikshire.

4. Π In reference to the extent of this grand and peculiat-
franohise, it would be a mieapprehension ‘oo suppose that
the bishops of Dux-ham, anterior to the Norman invasion,
possessed the whole district between the Tyne and the
TeeS, and enjoyed therein all fahe royal rights appui-be-
nant ‘oo a Palatinabe5 for it is indisputable that, at the
southern extremity of what, is now the County of Dur-
ham, there was a large tract known as the Wapentake of
Sadberge, which at the time of the Conquest was con-
sidered to be a pari, of the County of Northuinberland,
(though separated from it by many miles) ; perhaps by
reason of its forming part of the possessione of the ancient
earldom of Northumberland; but, how it became united
therebO, or separated therefrom, it has not been satis-
facborily ascertained; in all probability, it came to the
Crown when Roberb de Moubray was deprived of the
earldom sor tren-son}

¹ After the execution of Earl
Waltheof in '1075 the earldom was
purchased by Walcher, Biehop of
Dnrham. After hie murder, it was

· confer-red by william the conqueror

on Alberie, a Nox-man, who, being
found unfit sor public business, was
npeedily removed from that dignity‚
and Geoffiey, Bishop of Conamen,
appointed in his room- The authority
for this is the foundation chat-ter of
St. Mary'e abbey at York, in which
these words occur ε “ Eo tempore
“ (scil. An. 1088) Nox-thymbrorum
“ consulatum regebat.” Geoffrey

does not seem to have held the earl-
dom for any length of time ς for we
soon find it in the possession of hia
nephevv, Robert de Moubray, who,
committing treason against william
Rufus, was deprived of the earldom
of Northumberland and his other
possessione. The statement that
the Biehop of Coutances held the
earldom of Northumberland has
been denied, but the evidence of
the fact contained in the chartei· to
St. Mary’s abbey seems too clear to
be eet aside-
