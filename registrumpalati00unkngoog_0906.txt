The exact date at which this work was written is, according to the chronicler,
1250. The history is of considerable value as an illustration os the period during
which the author lived, and contains a good summai-y of the events which followed
the conquest. This minor chroniele is, however, based on another work (also
written· hy Matthew Paris) giving fuller details, which has been called the
“Historia Major? The chronicle here published, nevertheless, gives some
information not to be found in the greater history.

The “Book of Hyde ” is a compilation from much earlier sources, which are
usually indicated with considerable care and precision. In many casea however,
the Hyde chronicler appears to correct, to qualify, or to amplify—either from
tradition or from sources of information not now discoverable—the statements,
which, in substance, he adopts. He also mentione, and frequently quotes from
writers whose works are either entirely lost or at present known only by fragments.

There is to be found, in the “Book of Hyde,” much information relating to the

reign· of King Alfi-ed which is not known to exist elsewhere. The volume ·

contains some curious specimens of Anglo-Saxon and Mediseval English.

There is, in this volume, a legendary account of the peopling of Ireland and of
the adventures which befell the various heroes who are said to have been con-
nected with Irish history. ‘The details are, however, very meagre both for this
period and for the time when history becomes more authentic. The plan adopted
in the chroniele gives the appearance of an accuraey to which the earlier portions
of the work cannot have any claim. The succession of events is marked, year by
year, stom Ax. 1599 ιο Aa). 1150. The principa] events narrated in the later
portion of the work are, the invasions of foreigners, and the wars of the Irish
among themselves. The text has been printed from a MS. preserved in the
libi-ary of Trinity College, Dublin, written partly in Latin, partly in Irish.

Itis probable that Pierre de Langtoft was a canon of Bridlington, in Yorkshire,
and that he lived in the reign of Edward 1.‚ and during a portion of the reign of
Edward Π. This chroniele is divided into three parffl3 in the first is an
abridgment of Geoffrey of Momnouth’s “ Historia Britonum,” in the second, a
history of the &glo-Saron and Norman kings, down to the death of Henry ΠΙ.
and in the third a history of the reign of Edward Ι. The principal object of the
work was apparently to show the justice of Edward's Scottish wars. The
language is singularly corrupt, and a carious specimen of the French of Yorkshire.

The work in its present form, in the editor's opinion, is a comparatively modern

version os an undoubtedly ancient original. That it was compiled stom contem·
