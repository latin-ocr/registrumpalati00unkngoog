lxii PREFMJE.

'ffrssssfiffigm 1 21. These tenthS‚ now under consideration, were fre-

granteaby quently granted by the pope· to the kings of England to

‚ .
Ξέεξξὲἐὲῗ assist them in carrying out some pious or religious object,

such as the recovery of the Holy Land from the infidel.

{231ssstssss 122. The earliest mention I have found of a grant of
fisticum this annual tenth is when Pope Innocent IV. gave

it for three years to King Hem-y ΙΙΙ., for the pur-
pose of assisting him in his expedition to 1116 Holy
Land, which 116 had vowed to undertake. Pope Inno-
cent's buu, whereby this gift was made, gave great dis-
satisfaction to the clergy‚ who resisted it to the utmost of
their power. Those ⁸of the province of Canterbury, upon
being requested 1ο pay the tenth in question, told the
King plainly, that they could not take any step in

pope had granted to King Henry, for the term of three

yearS, the whole tenths of the revenues of the English

church, for 1116 purpose of providing necessaries for his

expedition 10 1116 Holy Land. In this bull there was

· this most offensive clause—“ That the collection was not

“ according 10 1116 will and decision of the ecclesiastical

“ commissionem to be appointed in every district.” Here

it may be remarked, that this could 1101 have been the

earliest papal grant of the kind, as 1116 collection was

not to be made according to the 0ch valuation‚ but
=according to a new one.

{ssbssss'ffffi 124. In all probability, no new yaluation, br even
