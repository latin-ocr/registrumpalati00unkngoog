ΜΑτοιι, Μ.Α., Fellow of St. John’s College, Cambridge. 1863-1869.

The compilet, Richard of cirencester, was a monk of westminster, 1365-
1400. In 1391 he obtained a licence to make a pilgrimage to Rome. His
history, in four books, extends stom 447 to 1066. He announces his intention
of continuing it, but there is no evidence that he completed any more. This
chronicle gives many chartei-s in favour of westminster Abbey, and a very mu
account of the lives and miracles of the saints, especially of Edward the Con-
sessor, whose reign occupies the fourth book. A treatise on the Coronation, by
william os Sndbury, a monk of westmmster, fills book iii. c. 3. It was on this

author that C. J. Bertram fathered his forgery, De Situ Brittania, in 1747.
