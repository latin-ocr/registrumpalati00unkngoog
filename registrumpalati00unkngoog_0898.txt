comes down to the year 1292, where it ends abruptly. The history is particu·.
larly valuable for notices of events in the eastern portione os the kingdom,

which are ”9¹² to be elsewhere obtained, and some curious facts are mentioned

relative to the floods in that part of England‚ which are confirmed in the Fries-

land Chronicle of Anthony Heinrich, pastor os the Island of Mohr.

These Poems are perhaps the most interesting of all the historica] writings of
the period, though they cannot be relied on sor accuracy of statement. They
are various in character 3 some are upon religious subjecta, some may be called

The author, a monk of Nor-vich, has here given us a Chronicle of England
stom the arrival of the Saxons in 449 to the year 1298, in or about which year
it appears that he died. The latter portion of this history (the whole of the
reign of Edward 1. more especiall ) is of great valae, as the writer was con-
temporary with the events which e recorde- An Appendix contains several
illustr-atim documenta connected with the previous narrative.

This work, also known as ‘⁸ The Chronicle of the Princes of Wales,” has
been attributed to Caradoc of Llancarvan‚ who flourished about the middle of
the twelfth century. Itis written in the ancient Welsh language‚ begins with
the abdication and death of Caedwala at Rome, in the year 681, and continues

This volume, like all the others in the series containing a miscellaneous selec·
tion of letters, is valuable on account of the light it throvs upon biographical
history, and the familiar view it presente of characters, manners, and events.
The period requires much elucidation3 to which it will materially contribute.
